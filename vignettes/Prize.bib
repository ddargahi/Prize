     abstract = {This paper is concerned with the representation of a multivariate sample of size $n$ as points $P_1, P_2,\ldots, P_n$ in a Euclidean space. The interpretation of the distance $\Delta(P_i, P_j)$ between the $i$th and $j$th members of the sample is discussed for some commonly used types of analysis, including both $Q$ and $R$ techniques. When all the distances between $n$ points are known a method is derived which finds their co-ordinates referred to principal axes. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a solution to exist in real Euclidean space is found. $Q$ and $R$ techniques are defined as being dual to one another when they both lead to a set of $n$ points with the same inter-point distances. Pairs of dual techniques are derived. In factor analysis the distances between points whose co-ordinates are the estimated factor scores can be interpreted as $D^2$ with a singular dispersion matrix.},
