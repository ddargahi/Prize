Description: The high throughput studies often produce large amounts of
        numerous genes and proteins of interest. While it is difficult
        to study and validate all of them. Analytic Hierarchy Process
        (AHP) offers a novel approach to narrowing down long lists of
        candidates by prioritizing them based on how well they meet the
        research goal. AHP is a mathematical technique for organizing
        and analyzing complex decisions where multiple criteria are
        involved. The technique structures problems into a hierarchy of
        elements, and helps to specify numerical weights representing
        the relative importance of each element. Numerical weight or
        priority derived from each element allows users to find
        alternatives that best suit their goal and their understanding
        of the problem.
